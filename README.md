### **Coffee Shop Retail Sales Analysis Project**

This project involves analyzing retail sales data from a coffee shop to gain actionable insights that can improve the shop's performance. The dataset includes transactional details like product categories, quantities sold, store locations, and the time of transactions. Using Excel, we performed a comprehensive analysis to identify sales patterns, peak business hours, popular products, and store-specific performance metrics. The goal is to understand customer behavior, optimize inventory, and improve operational efficiency.

### **Analysis and Findings**

#### 1. Peak Sales Hours:
   - **Key Insight**: Sales peak during **late morning to early afternoon**, particularly between **11 AM and 1 PM**.
   - **Actionable Insight**: Focus on promotions and efficient staffing during lunchtime, as this is when the coffee shop sees the most traffic. Introducing lunch combos or exclusive deals during these hours can increase average transaction value.

#### 2. Day of the Week Trends:
   - **Key Insight**: **Thursday** and **Friday** are the busiest days, with steady performance continuing into the weekend.
   - **Actionable Insight**: Use weekday promotions, particularly early in the week (e.g., Monday), to balance out sales. Promoting events or special offers on slower days can help maintain consistent traffic throughout the week.

#### 3. Top-Selling Products:
   - **Key Insight**: 
     - **Coffee** leads the sales, followed by **Tea** and **Bakery items**.
     - **Brewed Coffee** and **Herbal Teas** are the most popular product types.
   - **Actionable Insight**: Enhance cross-selling strategies by bundling coffee with bakery items. Create special promotions around popular products and experiment with introducing new seasonal flavors to keep the menu exciting for regular customers.

#### 4. Slow-Moving Products:
   - **Key Insight**: **Branded products** and **Packaged Chocolate** are the least sold items.
   - **Actionable Insight**: Consider running promotions or discounts to move these products or reassess their stock levels based on their performance. Additionally, improving their in-store placement could help attract more attention from customers.

#### 5. Store Location Performance:
   - **Key Insight**: All three locations—**Astoria**, **Hell's Kitchen**, and **Lower Manhattan**—show similar sales volumes and revenue.
   - **Actionable Insight**: Maintain consistent promotional strategies across all locations but consider **localized marketing** efforts based on each neighborhood’s demographic. Further analysis can help refine offerings that suit the local customer base.

#### 6. Popular Product Types:
   - **Key Insight**: Customers prefer **brewed coffee** and **brewed tea**, while other beverages and add-ons like **Flavours** see moderate sales.
   - **Actionable Insight**: Expand on the variety of coffee and tea offerings, possibly introducing more **seasonal options** or **exclusive brews**. Offering **loyalty programs** for frequent buyers could help retain the regular customer base and boost sales.

#### 7. Inventory Optimization:
   - **Key Insight**: Peak sales hours and best-selling products should guide stock replenishment. The dataset shows that coffee and tea are in highest demand.
   - **Actionable Insight**: Ensure that inventory levels for popular products are maintained, particularly during peak hours and days. On the other hand, reduce stock for slow-moving items to optimize costs and avoid wastage.

#### 8. Staffing Adjustments:
   - **Key Insight**: The highest sales occur during **lunchtime hours** and **toward the end of the week** (Thursday and Friday).
   - **Actionable Insight**: Adjust staffing levels accordingly, increasing the number of staff during peak times and reducing staff during off-peak periods to optimize labor costs without compromising service quality.

### **Additional Insights and Recommendations**

- **Cross-Selling Opportunities**: Bundling high-demand items like **coffee and tea** with slower-selling products such as **bakery items** can encourage higher overall spend per transaction.
- **Time-Based Promotions**: Introduce early morning (before 10 AM) or late afternoon (after 3 PM) discounts to encourage more traffic during slower hours of the day.
- **Seasonal Specials**: Offering limited-time products or deals, especially for coffee and tea, can attract new customers and retain regulars with fresh menu options.
